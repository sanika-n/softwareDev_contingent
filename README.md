1) The website titled "Pen It", allows users to store their notes, delete them anytime and also lets them listen to music while writing notes. There is a defualt audio file within the file, but the user has the option to change it and choose a file of their liking by uploading their file in the input space which will be visible after going on to the settings section.
2) I am the only team member
3) Features I wanted to include but couldnt:
   -creating log in passwords, so that multiple users can use the same website on a device
   -there is a site called gamma, that takes in a prompt and generates a ppt based on that using ai, i was hoping to create an api that could take in the notes and then using gamma convert it into a ppt
   -each user can create a secret mouse gesture, when the user uses this gesture on the website, it reveals the hidden notes which initially werent visible in the display, these can be further password protected if 
    required
   -using an api that would input photos with handwritten notes and convert them to digital notes
   -photo and audio insertions
   -add themes in the settings tab which would change the css being used
   -cloud backup
   -include a GPT api, that would make it easy to include ai generated text and images within the notes
   -enable autocomplete
   
   
5) Just download all the files and run the html in the same directory and run the html file
